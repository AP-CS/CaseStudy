This structure will be common to all projects--and will be backported to previous projects for some duration into the past--unless otherwise noted.

Directories: <-- This is the important part.
 - Eclipse: Contains an Eclipse project and the original source code.
 - Source: Contains a flattened copy of the source code for use with JCreator.
 x JCreator: (Excluded from this project; couldn't get JCreator working again.)
 - Precompiled: Contains a .jar for each project.  On Windows, double-click to execute.

(You can stop reading now.  You can read the rest later if you run into problems.)

Trivial Stuff Below _____________________________________________________

The Precompiled and Source folders are automatically generated by various custom Ant build files that can be found in the Eclipse directory.

The JCreator projects contain no actual source code; they use relative links to the Source folder.  So don't copy the JCreator folder and expect it to work, unless the Source folder comes with it.

Files:
 - CodeStyle.xml: Can be imported into Eclipse to get the proper code formatting.
 - .gitignore: Defines how the project is to be cleaned for redistribution via Git.
 - README.textile: The notice that is to appear on GitHub.  Stuff about academic honesty.
